# AI-agent-through-units-approach

1. Architected AGENK, a high-performance, cross-platform AI agent framework in pure C99, featuring a custom managed object-oriented runtime with a lock-free, in-memory registry and transactional LMDB persistence for fault-tolerant state management.

2. Designed a zero-copy Tensor Substrate implementing a lazy evaluation computational graph and optimized N-dimensional broadcasting kernels, enabling efficient hardware-agnostic tensor operations without external dependencies.

3. Developed a decentralized Network Fabric using C++ and gRPC, utilizing a Kademlia-based P2P mesh for service discovery and a high-throughput, thread-safe message queue to connect embedded C clients with SaaS backends.

4. Built a self-correcting Execution Substrate (the agent's "CPU") capable of safely acquiring, compiling (via TinyCC JIT), and executing untrusted code snippets at runtime, featuring a sandboxed "immune system" for automated error detection and recovery.

5. Engineered the Sensation Substrate, a modular perception framework that autonomously builds and integrates third-party libraries (e.g., libjpeg, ffmpeg) on-device to transduce novel data formats into standardized tensors without system updates.

6. Implemented a multi-tiered memory system combining chronological episodic recall, HNSW vector indexing for semantic search, and a contextual co-occurrence graph to ground cross-modal statistical relationships.
